<h1>About Homekuti</h1>

<section class="mb-4" style="max-width: 820px;">
  <p style="color:#4b5563; font-size:0.98rem;">
    Homekuti is a curated collection of homestays, cozy cottages, mountain retreats,
    and lived-in homes that actually feel like someone cared when they set them up.
    We’re trying to bridge the gap between <em>“I booked a room”</em> and
    <em>“I found a home for the weekend.”</em>

  <h2 style="font-size:1.2rem; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">Our Vision</h2>
  <p style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#4b5563;">
    We want Homekuti to be the place you open when you say,
    “I need a break, but I still want a place that feels like mine.”
    A platform where hosts showcase their spaces with pride and guests feel
    safe, informed, and genuinely welcomed.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#4b5563; margin-top:0.75rem;">
    Long term? Think discovery, community, and travel that doesn’t feel transactional.
    Short term? Clean UI, verified stays, and trips that don’t suck.
  </p>
